1. Start with a Clear Problem to Solve
**A successful business solves a real problem or fulfills a strong need. Ask yourself:**

Who is your customer?

What pain point are you solving?

Why would they pay you instead of someone else?

**2. Validate Before You Build**
Don’t invest big money upfront. Instead:

Build a minimum viable product (MVP) or prototype.

Test your idea with real users.

Get feedback, iterate, and improve.

**3. Know Your Numbers**
Even a basic financial understanding is critical. Make sure you:

Estimate startup and operating costs.

Understand pricing, margins, and cash flow.

Track income vs. expenses from day one.

**4. Start Small, but Think Long-Term**
Begin with what you can manage, but build with scale in mind:

Set a clear vision and mission.

Keep systems flexible to grow.

Don’t try to do everything at once—focus on your strengths.

**5. Build a Strong Online Presence**
Whether you're offline or online, digital visibility is key:

Set up a professional website or landing page.

Use social media to connect with your target audience.

Collect emails and build your own customer list from day one.
